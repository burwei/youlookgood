# youlookgood
This is an app to answer our girlfriend/wife's favorite fashion question: "How do I look?".

## How to use this app
There are 4 pages in this app:  
 - home page
 - picture taking page
 - target object marking page
 - analyzing and result page

So it's quite simple.  
 1 .You click "start" button in the home page to start.  
 2. You take a picture of your girlfriend/wife who is trying a new cloth/pents/bag... anything, whatever.
 3. You mark the target object by painting the whole object. The place you paint will be brighter in the result image to make it looks special.  
 4. After you finished marking the target object, and click "submit" button, nothing will be submit to anywhere and you'll go to the result page.  
 5. In the result page, this app will shows a random score and shows the text "You look good" in the result page after a fake analyzing process. Just like what we always do.  

The most important thing:  
The fake analyzing process will take 3~5 secs, so remember to show the result page to your girlfriend/wife right after you click the "submit" button.  
She'll see the analyzing process and see a good result she needs.  
Everyone is happy.
